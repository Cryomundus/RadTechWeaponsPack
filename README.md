# RadTechWeaponsPack

A collection of weapons for the GZDoom mod 'Hideous Destructor' made by Swampyrad and more.

## **Requires [HDBulletLib-Recasted](https://github.com/Gay-Snake-Squad/HDBulletLib-Recasted)!**

List of weapons and loadout codes:

Bernoulli M1053 Less-Lethal Shotgun [llh] (Less-Lethal shells - [lls])

- A polymer-based shotgun designed for riot control and crowd dispersion.
     Chambered only for the use of less-lethal shells, which contain
     a load of rubberized buckshot pellets. Useful for situations where
     maintaining a low fatality count is crucial.

Ithaca M37 Combat Shotgun [csg] - (Shells [shl])

- A compact shotgun often seen in the hands of space marines throughout the galaxy.
     Despite having no side saddles, or a butt stock to attach them to, in the right
     hands, it's still just as deadly as any other shotgun. Toss one in your pack the
     next time you roll out, it just might come in handy.

Delta Elite 10mm Pistol [p1m] (Magazines - [sc8])

- A handgun released in the late 80s, adopted by the FBI following
     the aftermath of a tragic shooting incident that resulted in the
     deaths of 2 special agents. This pistol offers better penetration
     and higher muzzle velocity than either 9mm or .355 firearms, but
     is much harder to control due to increased recoil.

Detective Special Snubnose Revolver - [snb] (.355 - [355])

- A sidearm once popular with police and private investigators of
     the past, this revolver fits better in your pocket, at a cost to
     accuracy and firepower.

Doomed Shotgun - [dsg] (Shells - [shl])

- A modified Hunter designed to mimic the behavior of the vanilla
     Doom shotgun, fitted with a duckbill choke for V-pattern spread
     and the old-school pump-action animation.

DM-93 Plasma Rifle [d93] (Batteries - [bat])

- An revised version of the "Thunder Buster" particle beam gun. After
    receiving a disturbing number of incident reports involving self-
    detonations caused by careless use of the Thunder Buster, UAC tasked
    a junior reseacher with finding a solution to this problem. The answer
    was found when they tweaked the ion emitter so that the plasma particles
    are contained in a electromagnetic field which holds it together until
    it impacts a target. This plasma has a smaller, but much safer blast
    radius, so direct contact is required to cause maximum damage. Auto-fire
    emits an accurate stream of projectiles, while Burst-fire shoots out a
    spread of multiple shots, useful for close encounters of the demon kind.

Flare Guns [FGN] [FGM] (Flare shells - [fsh])

- A common survival tool, useful for lighting up dark areas,
     or the occasional zombie or two. Can also fire buckshot shells,
     but only once before disintegrating. The metal version is less
     fragile, but much heavier.

Juan 9mm 'Horseshoe' Pistol - [jua] (Horseshoe mags - [j30])

- *j u a n .* A variant of the standard-issue pistol, albeit with a
non-standard issue magazine. As the name suggests, it uses a unique
"horseshoe" magazine that holds 30 rounds, as many as an SMG magazine.
However, its small size makes it hard to control in full-auto mode,
which experienced users remedy by using a "galloping" shooting pattern,
firing in short, controlled bursts to stay on target.

Hacked ZM66 Assault Rifle - [hzm] (Magazines - [450])

- A 'jailbroken' model of the Volt ZM66 rifle, this weapon has been
     stripped of most of its less desirable features, mainly its
     magcheck DRM system. The firerate is reduced and ammo counter is
     non-functioning, side effects of the jailbreaking process, but as
     a trade off, features a unique 4-round "Quad-Burst" firemode.

M-211 Semi-Automatic Gas-Operated Combat Weapon - [scw] (Magazines - [s25])

- A pistol-caliber carbine chambered in 10mm Auto, the trusted weapon
     of UAC's Light Drop Infantry division. Includes a bayonet attachment
     for close-quarters combat.

Minerva 9mm Chaingun - [mnv] (Magazines - [930])

- A support weapon chambered in 9mm, takes UAC SMG magazines and can
     hold a total of 150+5 rounds. Remember to hold onto those empties,
     you'll need them.

Obrozz Swan-Off Rifle Pistol - [obz] - (7.76mm - [7mm] [7mr] [710])

- An Obrez'd version of the Mk. IV Boss bolt-action rifle. A crude but deadly weapon, "Obrez" pistols were used by resistance members of the past for assasinations and self defense. The stock and barrel have been cut down to make one-handed firing possible, and its small size makes it easier to conceal than a full-length rifle.

Single Action Revolver - [rsa] (.45 LC ammo - [45l])

- An ancient firearm better suited for a gunslinger than a space marine.
     Chambered in .45 Long Colt, this revolver will definitely punch a hole
     in whatever it hits. Has a greater ricochet chance, handy for bouncing
     rounds off walls and performing trickshots.

Explosive Shotgun - [xsg] (Explosive shells - [xsh])

- The antithesis of the Less-Lethal Shotgun, this modified Hunter fires
 shells loaded with miniature HE grenade slugs, causing serious injuries
 and burns on impact. Use of this weapon is tight quarters is ill-advised,
 as the slug's propellant may 'splash' back, burning the user as well as
 the intended target.

Colt 1911 .45 Pistol - [c19] (Magazines - [cm7])

- An old service pistol made many centuries ago, using .45 ACP rounds as it's ammunition. Still packs quite a punch, getting relatively close to the 10mm Delta Elites used by police forces until recently. Just make sure to take good care of it.

Dynamite - [DYN]

- Apparently mostly re-surfacing after a large cult was found and dispatched by an unknown force, dynamite originally was known as a 'wild west' sort of thing usually used for mining out large areas. Currently though, it serves its job perfectly well by blowing up your foes.

Sten Mk. 2(S) - [MK2] (Magazines - [930])

- An old sub-machine gun designed and used by the British during WWII, known mostly for being problematic due to its jamming and overheating issues. This version has been modified with an integrally suppressed barrel, making its overall sound signature comparable to a handclap at best. Many compare it to the MP-46 SMG of today's time, though very few use it over that due to its many issues.

Stun Gun - [STU]

- A common device used for personal protection. Delivers high voltage into your foes, rendering them a smouldering pile of flesh.

"Hush Puppy" Silenced Pistol - [PUP]

- A modified 99FX with a suppressor attachment. Single-action only.
