# RadTechWeaponsPack
A collection of weapons for the GZDoom mod Hideous Destructor

List of weapons and loadout codes:

 Bernoulli M1053 Less-Lethal Shotgun [llh]
 - A modified Hunter designed for riot control and crowd dispersion.
     Chambered only for the use of less-lethal shells, which contain
     a load of rubberized buckshot pellets. Useful for situations where 
     maintaining a low fatality count is crucial.

Delta Elite 10mm Pistol [p1m] 
- A handgun released in the late 80s, adopted by the FBI following 
     the aftermath of a tragic shooting incident that resulted in the 
     deaths of 2 special agents. This pistol offers better penetration 
     and higher muzzle velocity than either 9mm or .355 firearms, but 
     is much harder to control due to increased recoil.
   
Detective Special Snubnose Revolver [snb] 
- A sidearm once popular with police and private investigators of 
     the past, this revolver fits better in your pocket, at a cost to 
     accuracy and firepower.

Doomed Shotgun [dsg] 
- A modified Hunter designed to mimic the behavior of the vanilla 
     Doom shotgun, with a wider spread and old-school pump action 
     animation.

Flare Gun [fgn; fgm, for metal variant] 
- A common survival tool, useful for lighting up dark areas,
     or the occasional zombie or two. Can also fire buckshot shells,
     but only once before disintegrating. The metal version is less
     fragile, but much heavier.

Juan Horseshoe Pistol [jua] 
- *j u a n .* A variant of the standard-issue pistol, albeit with a 
non-standard issue magazine. As the name suggests, it uses a unique
"horseshoe" magazine that holds 30 rounds, as many as an SMG magazine.
However, its small size makes it hard to control in full-auto mode,
which experienced users remedy by using a "galloping" shooting pattern,
firing in short, controlled bursts to stay on target.

Hacked ZM66 Assault Rifle [hzm] 
- A 'jailbroken' model of the Volt ZM66 rifle, this weapon has been
     stripped of most of its less desirable features, mainly its
     magcheck DRM system. The firerate is reduced and ammo counter is
     non-functioning, side effects of the jailbreaking process, but as 
     a trade off, features a unique 4-round "Quad-Burst" firemode.

M-211 Semi-Automatic Gas-Operated Combat Weapon [scw] 
- A pistol-caliber rifle chambered in 10mm Auto, the trusted weapon
     of UAC's Light Drop Infantry division. Includes a bayonet attachment
     for close-quarters combat.

Minerva 9mm Chaingun [mnv] 
- A support weapon chambered in 9mm, takes UAC SMG magazines and can
     hold a total of 150+5 rounds. Remember to hold onto those empties,
     you'll need them.

Single Action Revolver [rsa] 
- An ancient firearm better suited for a gunslinger than a space marine.
     Chambered in .45 Long Colt, this revolver will definitely punch a hole 
     in whatever it hits. Has a greater ricochet chance, handy for bouncing
     rounds off walls and performing kshots.

Explosive Shotgun [xsg]
 - The antithesis of the Less-Lethal Shotgun, this modified Hunter fires 
 shells loaded with miniature HE grenade slugs, causing serious injuries
 and burns on impact. Use of this weapon is tight quarters is ill-advised,
 as the slug's propellant may 'splash' back, burning the user as well as
 the intended target.
