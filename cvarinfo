// Most of these are server variables so in a multiplayer session they can be synced to other players.
// Every weapon has a comment before it's cvars based on it's name in-game for organization.
// Hopefully this will be readable on mobile, I have no idea and no real way to test it. - [Ted]

// NOTE: Values need to either be -1, 0, 2, 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 49, 99, 149 or 199 to work for the spawners! Anything else would require remaking the option values in the menus. - [Ted]
